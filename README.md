Sure! Here's a clean and informative `README.md` file tailored for your **Object Tracking using Siamese Network** project with the files you mentioned:

---

```markdown
# 🎯 Object Tracking using Siamese Network

This project implements a custom Siamese Network for object tracking from scratch. It includes training and testing pipelines, a Streamlit web application, and is compatible with GOT-10k-style datasets. The model is trained without any pre-trained weights, offering full control and transparency.

## 📦 Dataset

- This project uses a GOT-10k-style dataset:
  - Each folder contains sequential images.
  - `groundtruth.txt` holds bounding box coordinates.
  - `meta_info.ini` holds additional metadata.

📂 Example structure:
```
dataset/
└── video_001/
    ├── 00000001.jpg
    ├── 00000002.jpg
    ├── ...
    ├── groundtruth.txt
    └── meta_info.ini
```

---

## 🛠️ Setup

```bash
# Create a virtual environment (optional)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Add the following (or similar) to your `requirements.txt`:
```text
torch
torchvision
opencv-python
matplotlib
numpy
streamlit
Pillow
```

---

## 🚅 Training the Model

```bash
python train.py --data_path path/to/dataset --epochs 20 --batch_size 8
```

- The model is saved as `siamese_tracker.pth`.
- Training loss plots will also be generated.

---

## 🧪 Testing the Model

```bash
python test.py --model_path siamese_tracker.pth --video_path path/to/test/video.mp4
```

- This will run tracking on the video using the first frame as the reference (template).
- IoU and tracking performance will be displayed or saved.

---

## 🎬 Streamlit Demo App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Features:
- Upload a video
- Select an object in the first frame
- See it tracked across the video using the trained Siamese model

---

## 🧠 Model Architecture

The `model.py` file defines a custom Siamese CNN:
- Twin convolutional branches for template and search images.
- Feature distance calculated via cross-correlation.
- Output: predicted object location in search image.

---

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

During testing and app run, the following metrics are shown:
- IoU (Intersection over Union)
- MSE (Mean Squared Error)
- MAE (Mean Absolute Error)

---

## ✨ Acknowledgments

- Inspired by the GOT-10k tracking benchmark
- Built entirely from scratch (no pre-trained weights)

---

## 📌 Future Work

- Add YOLO-assisted tracking initialization
- Integrate with DeepSORT for multi-object tracking
- Enhance model with attention mechanisms or Transformers

---

## 🧑‍💻 Author

Made with ❤️ for research and learning.

Would you like me to generate a `requirements.txt` file too, or help turn this into a GitHub repository structure?
